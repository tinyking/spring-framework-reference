Spring 2.0 introduces a new abstraction for dealing with executors. Executors are the Java 5 name for the concept of thread pools. The "executor" naming is due to the fact that there is no guarantee that the underlying implementation is actually a pool; an executor may be single-threaded or even synchronous. Spring's abstraction hides implementation details between Java SE 1.4, Java SE 5 and Java EE environments. Spring's TaskExecutor interface is identical to the java.util.concurrent.Executor interface. In fact, its primary reason for existence was to abstract away the need for Java 5 when using thread pools. The interface has a single method execute(Runnable task) that accepts a task for execution based on the semantics and configuration of the thread pool. The TaskExecutor was originally created to give other Spring components an abstraction for thread pooling where needed. Components such as the ApplicationEventMulticaster, JMS's AbstractMessageListenerContainer, and Quartz integration all use the TaskExecutor abstraction to pool threads. However, if your beans need thread pooling behavior, it is possible to use this abstraction for your own needs.
