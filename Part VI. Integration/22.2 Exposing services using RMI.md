# 使用RMI暴露Services

Using Spring’s support for RMI, you can transparently expose your services through the RMI
infrastructure. After having this set up, you basically have a configuration similar to remote EJBs, except
for the fact that there is no standard support for security context propagation or remote transaction
propagation. Spring does provide hooks for such additional invocation context when using the RMI
invoker, so you can for example plug in security frameworks or custom security credentials here.

使用Spring支持RMI, 可以清晰的通过RMI发布服务。
