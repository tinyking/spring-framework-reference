## 17.13 Convention over configuration support
For a lot of projects, sticking to established conventions and having reasonable defaults is just what they
(the projects) need, and Spring Web MVC now has explicit support for convention over configuration.
What this means is that if you establish a set of naming conventions and suchlike, you can substantially
cut down on the amount of configuration that is required to set up handler mappings, view resolvers,
ModelAndView instances, etc. This is a great boon with regards to rapid prototyping, and can also lend
a degree of (always good-to-have) consistency across a codebase should you choose to move forward
with it into production.
Convention-over-configuration support addresses the three core areas of MVC: models, views, and
controllers.
